    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>
      Learn how to make hot and numbing Sichuan style water boiled beef (Shui
      Zhu Niu Rou) at home. Sichuan style water boiled beef is one of my
      favorite dishes in restaurants. If you ever tasted it in China, you will
      crazily love the tenderness of the beef slices and shocked by how well
      they are flavored in the hot and red broth.
